## Health Benefits

### üß† Binaural Beats
Binaural beats are an auditory illusion perceived when two slightly different frequencies are played in each ear. This phenomenon can influence brainwave activity, leading to various mental states:

- **Enhanced Focus:** Promote concentration and cognitive performance.
- **Stress Reduction:** Induce relaxation and alleviate stress.
- **Improved Sleep:** Facilitate better sleep quality and combat insomnia.
- **Meditation Aid:** Deepen meditation practices by guiding the brain into a state of calm.

### üåü Subliminal Affirmations
Subliminal affirmations involve embedding positive messages within audio tracks, often below the threshold of conscious perception. Benefits include:

- **Positive Mindset:** Reinforce self-confidence and positive thinking.
- **Habit Formation:** Support the development of healthy habits and behaviors.
- **Emotional Healing:** Aid in overcoming fears, anxieties, and negative emotions.
- **Motivation Boost:** Enhance motivation and goal achievement.

By combining binaural beats with subliminal affirmations, this app offers a comprehensive tool for personal development and mental well-being.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- **Python 3.7 or higher:** Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- **FFmpeg:** Required by `pydub` for audio processing.
  - **Installation Instructions:**
    - **Windows:** Download the FFmpeg executable from [FFmpeg Downloads](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) and add it to your system's PATH.
    - **macOS:** Install via Homebrew:
      ```bash
      brew install ffmpeg
      ```
    - **Linux:** Install via package manager (e.g., for Ubuntu/Debian):
      ```bash
      sudo apt-get install ffmpeg
      ```

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/binaural-beats-audio-converter.git
   cd binaural-beats-audio-converter
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**
   - **Using `requirements.txt`:**
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```
   - **Alternatively, install manually:**
     ```bash
     pip install streamlit pydub ibm-watson numpy matplotlib
     ```

4. **Set Up IBM Watson Credentials**
   - **Create a `.streamlit` Directory:**
     ```bash
     mkdir .streamlit
     ```
   - **Create a `secrets.toml` File Inside `.streamlit`:**
     ```toml
     # .streamlit/secrets.toml

     IBM_API_KEY = "your_ibm_api_key"
     IBM_URL = "your_ibm_service_url"
     ```
     > **Note:** Replace `"your_ibm_api_key"` and `"your_ibm_service_url"` with your actual IBM Watson Text-to-Speech credentials. Ensure this file is **never** committed to version control for security reasons.

5. **(Optional) Add a Banner Image**
   - Place a `banner.jpg` image in the root directory of the project.
   - Ensure the image path in the script matches its location. The line in the script is commented out by default:
     ```python
     # st.image("banner.jpg", use_column_width=True)
     ```
   - To enable the banner, uncomment the line:
     ```python
     st.image("banner.jpg", use_column_width=True)
     ```

6. **Run the Streamlit App**
   ```bash
   streamlit run subliminal_ibm_streamlit.py
